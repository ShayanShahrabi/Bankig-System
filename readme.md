> 8th grade coding project


## How the code works?
When the program starts, it asks for a username and a password. There are 2 choices:
- To log in as an admin, you shall write `ADMIN` (pay attention to capital letters) as both username and password
- To log in as a customer, you shall input the nationalID as username and your name as password
Once logged in as admin, you can create account for customers.


In order to exit the program, just kill it!

## How to run the code?
The only thing is to run the `main.py` file!
