> This repo contains my first ever coding project! My 8th grade final project for *Programming with Python* class in highschool (March 2018 - May 2018)

## Intro
The program, is an implementation of a banking system which runs through terminal. 

## How the code works?
The starting page of the program is a log in menu. There are 2 choices:
- To log in as an admin, you shall write `ADMIN` (pay attention to capital letters) as both **username** and **password**
- To log in as a customer, you shall input the **nationalID** as **username** and your **name** as **password**
Once logged in as admin, one can create account for new customers, delete accounts, search for an account and see a list of all the accounts created.

On the other hand, users can see their account info, transfer money from their account to others and see the history of their transcations.

In order to exit the program, just kill it!

## How to run the code?
The only thing is to run the `main.py` file!
